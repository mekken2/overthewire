# The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH
SSH should be pre-installed and accessible easily from terminal by running `ssh` command if you are on Linux or MacOS.
Windows too are coming with OpenSSH now-a-days but you can always download PuTTY if there is any sort of problem.

## Using Command Line
Enter the command `ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` and use `bandit0` for both username and password when prompted.

## Using PuTTY
Enter `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` in the host section and `2220` in the port section.
Use `bandit0` for both username and password
